You'll never escape, vile glop! Die! Die! Get ready! I hear one coming! I cannot answer this question, as it is against my religious principles. None dare attack us! We rule all!! AAAAUGH! Tiger attack! A bag of dead bugs I collected from our window sills. How quietly do you think we can nail these back in?</p>
